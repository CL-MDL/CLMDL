Code for CLMDL
================

This GitHub repository contains R functions to implement the CLMDL algorithm proposed in the paper arXiv:1904.06340. The CLMDL algorithm is designed for multiple change-point estimation in a spatio-temporal processes. The repository consists of two folders, *code* and *output*. The *code* folder contains the R codes and simulated data, and the *output* contains the corresponding RData files generated by the R codes.

### The code folder

The *code* folder has three R files, `DGP.R`, `Main. R` and `Util_Functions.R`.

1. The `DGP.R` file contains R code to simulate a spatio-temporal process based on the four-parameter autoregressive spatial model (see (22) in the manuscript), which is the parametric model employed by CLMDL for the numerical studies in the paper. In particular, on each stationary segment, we have $$\bf y_t-\mu = \phi (\bf y_t-\mu) +\epsilon_t,$$ where $\bf y_t\in \mathbb R^S$ is the observation on $S$ spatial locations on time $t$, $\mu$ is the mean parameter, $\phi$ is the temporal dependence parameter, and $\epsilon_t$ is a Gaussian process with exponential covariance function 
${\rm Cov}(epsilon_{t,\textbf{s}}, \varepsilon_{t,\textbf{s}'}) = \sigma^2\exp\{-\left\lVert \textbf{s}-\textbf{s}'\right\lVert_2/\rho\}$. This is a special case of the Matern covariance function with $\nu=0.5$.
